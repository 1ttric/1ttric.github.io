      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a love for large datasets and the interesting things one can do with them, so when my roommate sent me his entire Google Hangouts and Facebook chat history, I knew what I had to do.
Enter MarkBot Goals In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented plenty of basic character-level RNNs and trained them on all sorts of text corpora, but this time I wanted to try something different, and utilize word embeddings to try and produce a more coherent Mark-based chatbot.</description>
