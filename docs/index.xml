The following is a brief analysis.
Do note that names have been reduced to initials for privacy&amp;rsquo;s sake.
Reaction likelihood The first metric I was interested in viewing was a heatmap of the likelihood that one user will react to another user with a given emoji.</description></item><item><title>Adobe Lightroom as a hosted service?</title><link>https://vesey.tech/items/lightroom/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vesey.tech/items/lightroom/</guid><description>Background As someone with a significant photo library, I often find myself wishing I could access old photos from the road.
Although remote file access softwares can let me dive through the basic directories, I often wish I could use my Adobe Lightroom Classic instance to sort and filter the photos so I can find the ones I am looking for without searching.
The problem is, however, most of the time I only have my phone on me - and Lightroom Classic is a Windows-only product.</description></item><item><title>versefind</title><link>https://vesey.tech/items/versefind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vesey.tech/items/versefind/</guid><description>Ever remember a snatch of lyrics from a song you know you have saved in your Spotify library?
Ever search for that brief phrase in Google but find only unrelated tracks?
That can be enough to drive a person crazy. I wrote a tool that lets you search through your library to find these earworms.

Amazon doesn&amp;rsquo;t expose an easy API to allow us to scrape drive data. Hddcheap gives you that live data in an easy-to-read grid format.
(I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed the camelcamelcamel images will not load if you are on a VPN - they are likely blocking known VPN IPs)

We ended up with two server racks totalling about 12 Us of equipment, with high-speed data links, high-density storage, and plenty of blinkenlights.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a diagram of what we built:</description></item><item><title>MarkBot</title><link>https://vesey.tech/items/markbot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vesey.tech/items/markbot/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a love for large datasets and the interesting things one can do with them, so when my roommate sent me his entire Google Hangouts and Facebook chat history, I knew what I had to do.
Enter MarkBot Goals In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented plenty of basic character-level RNNs and trained them on all sorts of text corpora, but this time I wanted to try something different, and utilize word embeddings to try and produce a more coherent Mark-based chatbot.</description></item><item><title>test post please ignore</title><link>https://vesey.tech/items/testpostpleaseignore/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vesey.tech/items/testpostpleaseignore/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m no good at writing sample / filler text
